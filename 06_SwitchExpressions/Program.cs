//Challenge 
//We have 2 questions in our code:
//"How are you feeling today?
//"How were you feeling yesterday?

//we got 2 variables
//feelingRating
//yesterdayRating

//The challenge is to compare these two values and display how much better or worse 
//they are feeling today than yesterday.

//you don't have to use switch expressions for this challenge.
//use whatever works for you.

//Tools you should think about using:
//Converting strings to numbers
//Comparison Operators
//Conditionals
